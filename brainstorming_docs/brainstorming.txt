Alright. I had a couple ideas today, but I gotta get to sleep now.
Will pick back up tomorrow before work.

Theme:  I Dream of Ice Cream.

Game idea 1: You are an ice-cream man serving up scoops in a
cartoonish dreamscape. You attempt to toss scoops of ice cream
into the air, such that they arc into the awaiting cones.

Game idea 2: Largely similar to idea 1, except that you instead
control one or more cones, and attempt to catch the ice cream
man's wildly arcing scoops.

For both 1 and 2, I suggest a very dreamscapey atmosphere. I
imagine the cones/customers in layers, getting bigger according
to perspective as they are closer to the player. Art style would
not be pixel art, but would be simply/cartoonishly drawn in 2D.
As much squash and stretch for the sprites as possiblem, and
maximal fun/goofy sound effects.
I have more, but I gotta go sleep!
